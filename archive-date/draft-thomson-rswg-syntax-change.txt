                      Changing XML Syntax for RFCs
                draft-thomson-rswg-syntax-change-latest

Abstract

   The authoritative version of RFCs are published in an XML format.
   This format is chosen for its ability to capture semantic details.  A
   policy governing how the RFC XML format changes is described.

1.  Rationale

   The canonical format for published RFCs is XML [RFC7990].
   Historically, the published version of an RFC has been immutable
   (Section 7.6 of [RFC9280]).

   The RFC XML format [RFC7991] is not able to address use cases that
   were not originally anticipated during its design.  It might also be
   possible to improve the format to better capture meaning.

   Though it might be possible to evolve the format and only use the new
   format for the publication of new RFCs, this would mean that there
   would be no single format across the series.  Tools that seek to
   process RFC XML would need to understand all iterations of the
   format.

2.  Syntax Change Policy

   The RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), constituted by [RFC9280], acts
   as custodian for the RFC XML format.  If the RSWG reaches consensus,
   they can propose a revision to the RFC XML format.

   The RSWG publishes an RFC on the Editorial stream that describes the
   format change.  An updated XML format is used for the publication of
   new RFCs.  Some time might be necessary to implement those changes in
   tools and active documents.

   Existing RFCs can be updated to use the new format.  The RFC that
   describes format changes can also describe how the XML of existing
   RFCs will be updated.

   Updates to the RFC XML format need to ensure that any change to
   existing RFCs preserves -- to the greatest extent possible -- the
   semantics expressed in the original RFC.  That is, the intent is that
   changes only update the XML syntax, they do not alter the semantics
   that are expressed using that syntax.

   This process does not require that updates to XML avoid all risk of
   introducing semantic changes to existing RFCs.  Instead, it only
   requires that the RSWG carefully consider the potential for semantic
   changes, take steps to understand the risk of a semantic change
   (either deliberate or inadvertent), and to limit those risks.

2.1.  Canonical Version

   When the RFC XML for an RFC is updated, the updated document becomes
   the canonical version of that RFC.

2.2.  Archival

   When the RFC XML of an RFC is updated, the updated document shall be
   archived in addition to the existing version.  Any archive shall
   record the date that a document was created or revised.

   This document does not specify how archives are maintained or how
   archived RFC XML might be located or identified.

2.3.  Publication Formats

   Publication formats are produced from the RFC XML format.  As the RFC
   XML format of a document changes, publication formats can change,
   even if this might not result in observable differences.  Similarly,
   as production tools change, publication formats can be regenerated to
   ensure a consistent presentation across the series.

   Publication formats -- or the contexts in which they are displayed --
   can optionally provide additional details of the specific RFC XML
   version that they were generated from, or provide a means to discover
   alternative renderings.

   This document does not stipulate whether production formats are
   archived.

3.  Security Considerations

   The RSWG are responsible for managing the risk of semantic changes
   that would affect the interpretation of existing and future RFCs.
   Changes to content that has security implications would have
   security-relevant consequences.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
